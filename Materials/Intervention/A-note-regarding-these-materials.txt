The *.txt and *.doc files in this folder contain the text used in the intervention news articles. I have also included the primary images used in these articles. The location of these images within the body of the original article is indicated by [IMAGE HERE] in the *.txt files. I have retained some very minimal html mark-up in the txt files, to display where emphasis was used or to identify the image files.

The news articles used in the original experiment for the Design and Brain conditions were originally rendered using an .html/css script to match the design of a major Australian newspaper. The Industry intervention was rendered as a simple webpage for a fictitious lobby group. Following advice from our university legal department these have not been included as open materials due to legal concerns about how closely these files resembled the original publication. There were additional concerns raised about the name chosen for the lobby group intervention, so this has also been redacted from open source materials.
