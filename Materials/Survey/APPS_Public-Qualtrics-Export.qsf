Pokies gambling has\n    been a topic of political debate and has drawn attention in a number of news\n    media outlets. We are interested in how the community views and responds to\n    these discussions.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>Why were you chosen for this research?<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    You have been invited to participate in this research because you have\n    previously indicated that you are willing to be contacted to participate in\n    survey research.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>Who is eligible to participate in this research?<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    Anyone living in Victoria or NSW who is over the age of 18 is eligible to\n    participate in this research. We want to hear from a wide range of views on\n    this important social issue. We would like to hear from you whether or not\n    you have had any personal experience with gambling.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>What are you being asked to do?<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    You will first be asked to provide some basic demographic information. We\n    collect this information to ensure that our survey has reached a wide range\n    of Australians living in NSW and Victoria. You will then be asked to read\n    about and consider a number of topics related to pokies gambling. Most\n    questions will ask you to respond to statements using a standard response\n    scale.<br><\/p>\n  <br>\n  <p>The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.<\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>Participation is entirely voluntary<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    Participation in this research study is voluntary and you are completely free\n    to withdraw at any time. Any associations you have with Monash University or\n    the researcher will not be affected by not participating or withdrawing from\n    the study prior to conclusion.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>\n    You may withdraw by closing the survey window or the web browser in which the\n    survey is open. Note that any responses submitted prior to closing the survey window\n    will already have been recorded.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>\n    If you wish to withdraw your responses, you will need to contact the researcher\n    directly. Please note that it may not be possible to remove or delete your responses\n    following consent to participate in this study. This is a consequence of the\n    study being anonymised to protect your identity. Also note that in contacting\n    the researcher you may reveal your identity through your email address or\n    correspondence.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>What are the potential risks and benefits of taking part?<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    This study explores issues related to gambling. We acknowledge that the topic\n    of gambling may be upsetting or confronting for some individuals. Contact\n    details for a number of gambling and psychological counselling services are\n    provided at the conclusion of this study as well as at the bottom of this page.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>\n    There are no other obvious or known risks associated with participating in\n    the study. Should you choose to participate, you will be contributing to a\n    research effort that aims to improve our understanding of this important\n    social issue.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <h3>Confidentiality<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    All data collected in the study will be anonymised. In order to protect your\n    identity, your responses will be assigned an anonymous I.D. number. It is\n    highly unlikely that it would be possible to identify you personally from\n    your survey responses.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Online survey platforms collect device information to help identify duplicate\n    or automated responding. This information will not be used to identify you\n    personally and will be destroyed after it has been used to ensure data quality.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n  <h3>How will my information be used and stored?<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    Data will be collated, statistically analysed and may form part of a research\n    thesis. The results may also be presented at research conferences, presentations\n    or included in a published research journal. Public presentations and publications\n    will only report aggregate and anonymised data and will not identify you personally.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>\n    All data collected will be stored in accordance with Monash University regulations.\n    Data collected for this project may be retained indefinitely or for an extended\n    period. Data collected for the current study may be used in future research\n    projects or made available to other researchers in accordance with open science\n    principles.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Anonymous data may be made available to other researchers at public research\n    institutions or through the Open Science Framework. This is to allow for the\n    possibility of peer review, replication studies, re-analyses, quality control\n    and meta-analyses. If made available to other researchers, these data will be\n    anonymous and made available under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence\n    that forbids the use of these data for commercial gain.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n  <h3>Complaints<\/h3>\n  <p>\n    Should you have any concerns or complaints about the conduct of this project,\n    you are encouraged to contact the Executive Officer, Monash University\n    Human Research Ethics (MUHREC):\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n  <table style=\"font-size: .875rem;\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <span><strong>Email: <\/strong>muhrec@monash.edu<\/span><br>\n          <span><strong>Tel: <\/strong>+61 3 9905 2052<\/span><br>\n          <span><strong>Fax: <\/strong>+61 3 9905 3831<\/span><br>\n          <br>\n          <span><strong>Address:<\/strong><\/span><br>\n          <span>\n            Executive Officer<br>\n            Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC)<br>\n            Room 111, Chancellery Building D,<br>\n            26 Sports Walk, Clayton Campus<br>\n            Research Office<br>\n            Monash University VIC 3800<br>\n          <\/span><br>\n        <\/td>\n      <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n  <\/table>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>\n    If you have any further questions or concerns after reading this information\n    statement, you may contact the researchers via the contact details provided.\n  <\/p>\n  <br>\n\n  <p>Thank you,<br><\/p>\n  <br>\n  <p>Associate Professor Adrian Carter<\/p>\n  <br>\n<hr>\n\n  <h3>Support Services:<\/h3>\n\n  <span style=\"font-size: .875rem;\">\n    <strong>Gamblers Help:<\/strong>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Phone: <\/strong>1800 858 858<br>\n    <strong>Hours: <\/strong>24\/7<br>\n    <strong>Website: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gamblershelp.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/gamblershelp.com.au\/<\/a><\/span><br>\n    <br>\n    <span style=\"font-size: .875rem;\">\n      <strong>Mental Health Resources<\/strong><br>\n    <p>\n      The Australia Department of Health maintains a comprehensive list of trusted\n      mental health related information and support services on the\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/headtohealth.gov.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Head to Health website<\/a>\n    \n<\/p><hr>\n\n\n<\/span>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Explanatory Statement Project ID: 17815Project Title: Australian Attitudes to Pokies Gambling You...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<h2>Explanatory Statement<\/h2>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<h3>What is this study about?<\/h3>\n<br>\n\n<p>This research study aims to survey community opinions regarding a range of political and social issues related to pokies gambling.

More than $15 billion of these loses occur on poker machines alone. But why are the pokies so attractive? And why do people spend so much on them?<\/p>\n        <p>Poker machines have been carefully engineered for over a century to keep gamblers hooked. These seemingly simple devices have been perfected by an army of engineers, programmers, mathematicians and graphic artists, yielding ever more inventive methods to encourage punters to spend more and keep gambling. This includes a number of sleight of hand tactics to enhance gambling\u2019s addictive potential.<\/p>\n        <p>This has prompted gambling researchers and mental health professionals to sound the alarm that this design feature contributes to the addictive power of poker machines.<\/p>\n        <p>The anthropologist Natasha Sch\u00fcll has spent decades studying the rise of slot machine gambling. In her book <em>Addiction by Design<\/em>, Sch\u00fcll documents the efforts by the gambling industry to deliberately design pokies that keep people gambling as long as possible. <\/p>\n        <p>How long someone gambles, or what insiders call \u2018time on device\u2019, is the key to maximising revenue. The longer someone gambles determines how much the house takes in overall.<\/p>\n        <p>As one gambling industry insider explained to Sch\u00fcll, <em>\u201cthe key is duration of play. I want to keep you there as long as humanly possible, that\u2019s the whole trick\u201d<\/em>. <\/p>\n        <p>One of the most insidious tactics for keeping players glued to their seats emerged with modern poker machines that allow the user to place simultaneous bets across multiple lines.<\/p>\n        <p>Betting on multiple lines doubles the chance that a win will be displayed somewhere on the screen, creating a vastly more exciting experience and an urge to keep gambling, especially in problem gamblers. <\/p>\n        <p>But each line played also increases the total cost of the bet so that the punter will still lose about the same amount of money overall, regardless of whether they chose to gamble on 25 lines or a single line.<\/p>\n        <p>Multiline betting also enables what Professor Mike Dixon at the University of Waterloo in Canada calls <em>\u201closses disguised as wins\u201d<\/em>. <\/p>\n        <p>Say you bet 10 cents per line across 20 lines for a total bet of $2.00 (20 lines x $0.10 = $2.00). The reels spin and stop one at a time to reveal a small win of $1.50. The machine flashes with lights and sounds to indicate that you have won. But in this case, you have just <em>lost<\/em> $0.50.<\/p>\n\n        <div class = 'image'><img src = \"https:\/\/monash.az1.qualtrics.com\/ControlPanel\/Graphic.php?IM=IM_aVi5LCMP8lKnXoN\" width = 100%\/><\/div>\n        <div class = 'image-caption'>An example of a loss disguised as a win. Although the machine has celebrated a \u201cwin\u201d of $1.50 on the three starfish, the total bet was $2.00, making for an overall loss of $0.50<\/div>\n\n        <p>These events can occur as often as true wins, which means they could drastically increase the addictive potential of pokies gambling. Professor Dixon and his colleagues have found that many gamblers appear to mistakenly view these losses as real wins, and that physiological markers such as heartrate or perspiration indicate the same level of excitement that occurs following a small win.<\/p>\n        <p>Sch\u00fcll\u2019s interviews with the engineers who designed these machines make it clear that losses disguised as wins are a deliberate design feature to maximise time spent gambling and therefore industry profits. Perhaps the most blatant example is an interview with Randy Adams of Anchor Gaming, who explains the feature to Sch\u00fcll:<\/p>\n        <p><em>\u201cThe perception is that you\u2019re winning all the time, when you\u2019re really not\u2014 you\u2019re putting 25 in and winning 15 back, 45 in and 30 back, over and over.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n        <p>The evidence clearly suggests that pokies are not only addictive, but that they have been intentionally designed to be addictive in pursuit of enormous private profits. Those revenues are larger here in Australia than anywhere else in the world. Given what we now know \u2014 it might be time to kick the habit.<\/p>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class = 'bluerule'><\/div>\n

This means that there\n  were 4 alternative versions of the survey displayed to different participants.\n  The major difference was the content of the article shown at the beginning of\n  the survey. There was also a control condition in which no article was shown.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\n  Two newspaper style articles were composed for the purpose of this study by the study\n  authors. The news articles did not appear in this exact form in any newspaper.\n  Despite being composed for the study the researchers ensured that all\n  information reported in these articles was an accurate plain language account\n  of current research.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\n  A media release by a fictitious community organisation was also composed by the\n  study authors for the purpose of the study. Although this organisation does\n  not exist, the release was closely modelled on historical documents released\n  by comparable community organisations in Australia.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\n  If you have questions about this feature of the study you are free to contact\n  the study author using the contact information below.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<h3>Research Funding<\/h3>\n<br>\n<p>\n  This research project is supported by an Australian Government Research Training\n  Program (RTP) Scholarship as well as a Gambling Research Capacity Grant from the\n  New South Wales Office of Responsible Gambling.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<h3>Researcher Contact Information<\/h3>\n<br>\n\n<p>\n  If you would like to receive further information about the results of this\n  research when it becomes available you can contact the researcher via email\n  and request a summary of findings.

If you choose to provide a contact email address this information\n  will only be used to send you information related to the findings of this\n  research. Please be advised that the analysis of research findings can take\n  many months and so a summary of results may take some time.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>\n  If you have any further questions or concerns, you may contact the researchers\n  via the email addresses provided below.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"contacttable\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Chief Investigator<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Associate Professor<br>Adrian Carter<\/div>\n      <\/td>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Co-Investigator<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Professor<br>Kerry O'Brien<\/div>\n      <\/td>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Student Researcher<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Dan Myles<\/div>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> adrian.carter@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          Turner Institute for Brain &amp; Mental Health<br>\n          School of Psychological Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n      <td>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> kerry.o'brien@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          School of Social Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n      <td>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> dan.myles@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          Turner Institute for Brain &amp; Mental Health<br>\n          School of Psychological Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n\n<table class=\"mobiletable\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Chief Investigator:<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Associate Professor<br>Adrian Carter<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> adrian.carter@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          Turner Institute for Brain &amp; Mental Health<br>\n          School of Psychological Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Co-Investigator:<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Professor<br>Kerry O'Brien<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> kerry.o'brien@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          School of Social Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <div><strong>Student Researcher:<\/strong><\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactB\">Dan Myles<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\"><strong>Email:<\/strong> dan.myles@monash.edu<\/div>\n        <div class=\"contactdeets\">\n          Turner Institute for Brain &amp; Mental Health<br>\n          School of Psychological Sciences<br>\n          Monash University\n        <\/div>\n      <\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3>Seeking Help For Gambling-Related Harm<\/h3>\n<br>\n\n<p>This study has included a number of questions about gambling-related issues.
