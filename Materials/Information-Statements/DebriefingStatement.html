<h2>Thank You!</h2>
<br/>

<p>Thank you for participating in this research project. Your responses have now been recorded.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Debriefing Information</h2>
<br/>

<p>
  This research employed a randomised experimental design. This means that there
  were 4 alternative versions of the survey displayed to different participants.
  The major difference was the content of the article shown at the beginning of
  the survey. There was also a control condition in which no article was shown.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Two newspaper style articles were composed for the purpose of this study by the study
  authors. The news articles did not appear in this exact form in any newspaper.
  Despite being composed for the study the researchers ensured that all
  information reported in these articles was an accurate plain language account
  of current research.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  A media release by a fictitious community organisation was also composed by the
  study authors for the purpose of the study. Although this organisation does
  not exist, the release was closely modelled on historical documents released
  by comparable community organisations in Australia.
</p>
