  <h3>What is this study about?</h3>
  <p>
    This research study aims to survey community opinions regarding a range of
    political and social issues related to pokies gambling. Pokies gambling has
    been a topic of political debate and has drawn attention in a number of news
    media outlets. We are interested in how the community views and responds to
    these discussions.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Why were you chosen for this research?</h3>
  <p>
    You have been invited to participate in this research because you have
    previously indicated that you are willing to be contacted to participate in
    survey research.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Why were you chosen for this research?</h3>
  <p>
    Anyone living in Victoria or NSW who is over the age of 18 is eligible to
    participate in this research. We want to hear from a wide range of views on
    this important social issue. We would like to hear from you whether or not
    you have had any personal experience with gambling.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3>What are you being asked to do?</h3>
  <p>
    You will first be asked to provide some basic demographic information. We
    collect this information to ensure that our survey has reached a wide range
    of Australians living in NSW and Victoria. You will then be asked to read
    about and consider a number of topics related to pokies gambling. Most
    questions will ask you to respond to statements using a standard response
    scale. Towards the end of the study you will be asked to view a short video
    (2 min 34 seconds) depicting a poker machine in operation.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>The survey should take not take longer than 25 minutes to complete.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Participation is entirely voluntary</h3>
  <p>
    Participation in this research study is voluntary and you are completely free
    to withdraw at any time. Any associations you have with Monash University or
    the researcher will not be affected by not participating or withdrawing from
    the study prior to conclusion.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p>
    You may withdraw by closing the survey window or the web browser in which the
    survey is open. Note that any responses submitted prior to closing the survey window
    will already have been recorded.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p>
    If you wish to withdraw your responses, you will need to contact the researcher
    directly. Please note that it may not be possible to remove or delete your responses
    following consent to participate in this study. This is a consequence of the
    study being anonymised to protect your identity. Also note that in contacting
    the researcher you may reveal your identity through your email address or
    correspondence.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3>What are the potential risks and benefits of taking part?</h3>
  <p>
    This study explores issues related to gambling. We acknowledge the that topic
    of gambling may be upsetting or confronting for some individuals. Contact
    details for a number of gambling and psychological counselling services are
    provided at the conclusion of this study as well as at the bottom of this page.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p>
    There are no other obvious or known risks associated with participating in
    the study. Should you choose to participate, you will be contributing to a
    research effort that aims to improve our understanding of this important
    social issue.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
  <p>
    All data collected in the study will be anonymised. In order to protect your
    identity, your responses will be assigned an anonymous I.D. number. It is
    highly unlikely that it would be possible to identify you personally from
    your survey responses.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Online survey platforms collect device information to help identify duplicate
    or automated responding. This information will not be used to identify you
    personally and will be destroyed after it has been used to ensure data quality.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h3>How will my information be used and stored?</h3>
  <p>
    Data will be collated, statistically analysed and may form part of a research
    thesis. The results may also be presented at research conferences, presentations
    or included in a published research journal. Public presentations and publications
    will only report aggregate and anonymised data and will not identify you personally.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <p>
    All data collected will be stored in accordance with Monash University regulations.
    Data collected for this project may be retained indefinitely or for an extended
    period. Data collected for the current study may be used in future research
    projects or made available to other researchers in accordance with open science
    principles.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Anonymous data may be made available to other researchers at public research
    institutions or through the Open Science Framework. This is to allow for the
    possibility of peer review, replication studies, re-analyses, quality control
    and meta-analyses. If made available to other researchers, these data will be
    anonymous and made available under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence
    that forbids the use of these data for commercial gain.
